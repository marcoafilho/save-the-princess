Save the Princess is a browser game that allows players to create worlds and
also dive into them. The rules used here are based on the simple [3D&T][3d&t] role-playing game.

## Getting started

After cloning the repo, go to the project's root folder and run:

```shell
rake db:setup
rails s
```

After that you can access http://localhost:3000 and enjoy the game.
